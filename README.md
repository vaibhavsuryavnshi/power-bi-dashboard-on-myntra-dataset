Project: Advanced Data Analysis and Visualization using Power BI

In this project, I integrated and analyzed four datasets: a date table, dim customers, dim product, and facts orders. I began by transforming and correcting the data to ensure accuracy before loading it into Power BI for detailed analysis and visualization.

Key deliverables included:

State-wise Sales Analysis: Visualized sales distribution across different states for categories such as beauty, kids, men, and women.
Category and Product Insights: Developed a donut chart to represent the percentage distribution of products by category, and analyzed total sales distribution by category and revenue by state.
Year-over-Year Sales Trends: Created visualizations to track total sales by category over the years 2021, 2022, and 2023.
Discount and Revenue Analysis: Explored total sales amounts by discount and calculated total revenue, average sales amount, and average discount across different categories.
Brand and Product Distribution: Analyzed brand distribution and product count by sales, providing insights into brand performance.
Interactive Dashboards: Implemented dropdown lists for dynamic filtering by category, brand name, sub-category, and year.
Additionally, I developed custom measures in Power BI, such as total revenues by brand, total orders, average discount, total sales amount, and product count, to enhance the depth of analysis and insights derived from the data.
